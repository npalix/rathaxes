\section{Objectives for 2012}

At the end of 2012 the project should be usable by any driver programmer with
working examples on actual hardware.

The project will follow several steps which includes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Researches to find the semantic of buses (like PCI, USB, i2c, \ldots)
usage in peripheral drivers;
\item Implementation of buses and their algorithms in the DSL;
\item Add new templates in the \BL.
\end{enumerate}

Along with the project the Rathaxes team will be present on the open source
scene.
