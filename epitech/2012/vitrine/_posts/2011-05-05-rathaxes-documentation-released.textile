title: Rathaxes Documentation Released
---

h1. {{ page.title }}

We are pleased to announce our first public release. It is still documentation only but it contains everything to setup a local copy of the project on your computer, whether you are using Windows or any Unix like.

You will also find a preview of the new organisation of the language: front-end, __middle-end__ and back-end.

The first release of the compiler is scheduled for the summer.

The documentation is available on our google code: "firststeps_en.pdf":http://rathaxes.googlecode.com/files/firststeps_en.pdf.
